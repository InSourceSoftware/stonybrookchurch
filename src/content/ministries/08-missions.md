  <span class="fw-700 color-primary family-display">Isaiah 52:7</span> says &ldquo;How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news!&rdquo;
  Our desire to make disciples through missions stems from our own faith&mdash;which we have only because someone shared the gospel with us first.
  Our vision is to use time, talent, and treasure in making disciples through our local and global missionaries, so that we can pass on the faith that was passed to us.
