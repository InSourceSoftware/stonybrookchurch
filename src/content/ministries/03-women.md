description:
  While family or work life piles on responsibilities, seek out opportunities to draw closer to God through the encouragement and discipleship from other women at Stony Brook.
  A variety of ministries take place throughout the year, which include gathering in homes over coffee and casual conversation, and a yearly retreat that delves deeper in Godâ€™s word.
