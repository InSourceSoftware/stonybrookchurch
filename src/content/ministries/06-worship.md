  In <span class="fw-700 color-primary family-display">John 4:23</span>, Jesus says the Father is seeking true worshipers, and this is the reason we desire to be a worshiping church.
  The heartbeat of our worship team is to set the atmosphere for people to encounter God in community together.
  During our service times we encounter God in joy, brokenness, humility, peace, and love.
