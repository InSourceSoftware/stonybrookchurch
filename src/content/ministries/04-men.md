description:
  We don't have many opportunities to share and be transparent with other men and believers.
  So many of us have walked the same roads and faced the same struggles.
  Whether it's over coffee and donuts on Saturday mornings, Fire Time once a month, or the annual Men's Retreat, there is no replacement for the wisdom, grace and camaraderie we share together.
  # The time I've spent connecting with my brothers in Christ on Saturday mornings has really helped replenish me after a long and arduous week.
  # The attentive ear offered at the beginning of every meeting has really helped me open up and be vulnerable where I feel I cannot with my family.
  # I can be assured that whatever book we are going through is Christ centered and full of scriptural references that will offer guidance and inspiration to lift us up throughout the week.
  # After we wrap up our session with praise and prayer requests, I can count on some donuts to come home with the kids or an invitation to breakfast if I have the time.
  # All in all there is no replacement for the wisdom, grace and camaraderie shared during Men's Saturday Morning Growth Group and I am blessed for the fellowship of such a supportive group of men.
  # Glory to God
  # That is a blessing in itself.
  # God is the ultimate bond.
  # The Holy Spirit has a way to unite His family!
