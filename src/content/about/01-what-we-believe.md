At Stony Brook Church we believe in Jesus. Period.
Of course, there's a lot to that.
Let's break it down.

At Stony Brook Church we believe that Jesus is God in human flesh, that he was born a virgin birth, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died a vicarious and atoning death on our behalf, was raised to life by the Father that we too might have life in His name, and will one day return in power and glory (John 20:31, Titus 2:13).
We believe that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant and authoritative Word of God, sufficient for the equipping of believers and a guide for Christian living (Hebrews 4:12, 2 Peter 1:19-21, 1 Timothy 3:16-17, Ephesians 4:17).
We believe in the triune nature of God, who exists eternally in three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19).
We believe that every Christian receives the indwelling of the Holy Spirit at the moment they believe in Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of their sins and makes him the Lord of their life (2 Timothy 1:14).
We believe that everyone sins and deserves death but is offered eternal life, and also that salvation cannot be earned but is a gift of God (Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, Ephesians 2:8-10).
