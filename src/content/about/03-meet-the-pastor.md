On September 12, 2021, the church welcomed back Pastor Jon, Lauren, and Oliver Annin.

I say welcomed them back because Millard Bible Church, which eventually became Stony Brook, was his home church growing up!
Jon moved to Fresno, California after high school to attend Fresno Pacific University.
There he completed his Bachelor’s degree in 2003 and began serving as the Youth Pastor at the Clovis Hills Church in Clovis, California.
He continued to serve there (moving from Youth to Children and then to Campus Pastor) while completing his Master’s degree from Bethel Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota.
When an opportunity to return to Omaha presented itself, they felt it was the leading of God and applied.
The Search Committee of Stony Brook also felt God’s leading and presented them to the congregation which cast a unanimous affirmation vote!
